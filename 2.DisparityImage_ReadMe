0.The code to obtain disparityImage from stereo camarea written in "DisparityMap.cpp"
1.To obtain disparity image from sample image  : 
    $ ./disparityImage aloeL.jpg aloeR.jpg
2. Real time (Input image from video streaming): 
    $./disparityImage 

   Note : It noisy when run in real time as result : in folder "Result/realtime.png". 
          Idea to solve : 1. Implement pre-processing 
                          2. Detect indiviual object to obtain 3D point cloud.


3. OpenCVBM is program used to tune the parameter for opencv disparity function.
